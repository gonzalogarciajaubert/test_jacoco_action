# Runnable Workflows Demonstrating the [cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator) GitHub Action

### Basic case: [.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml)

Here are the badges it produces:

![coverage](.github/badges/jacoco.svg)
![branches coverage](.github/badges/branches.svg)

The above was inserted into this README with the following
markdown:

```markdown
![coverage](.github/badges/jacoco.svg)
![branches coverage](.github/badges/branches.svg)
```

### Dedicated Badges Branch: [.github/workflows/build-badges-branch.yml](.github/workflows/build-badges-branch.yml)

Here are the badges that result from this workflow:

![coverage](../badges/jacoco.svg)
![branches coverage](../badges/branches.svg)

The above badges were inserted with the following markdown:

```markdown
![coverage](../badges/jacoco.svg)
![branches coverage](../badges/branches.svg)
```


### JSON Endpoints Instead of SVG: [.github/workflows/build-json.yml](.github/workflows/build-json.yml)

Here are the badges as generated by Shields from the JSON endpoints:

![coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator/main/.github/badges/jacoco.json)
![branches coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator/main/.github/badges/branches.json)

The above badges were inserted with the following markdown:

```markdown
![coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator/main/.github/badges/jacoco.json)
![branches coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator/main/.github/badges/branches.json)
```

The general format of the markdown required is as follows:

```markdown
![coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/BRANCHNAME/.github/badges/jacoco.json)
![branches coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/BRANCHNAME/.github/badges/branches.json)
```

to use one of their alternate styles, you can select that as an additional URL parameter.

Here is an example that directs Shields to use the Shields style "for-the-badge", rather
than the default "flat" style:

![coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator/main/.github/badges/jacoco.json&style=for-the-badge)
![branches coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator/main/.github/badges/branches.json&style=for-the-badge)

The markdown that was used for the above badges is as follows:

```markdown
![coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator/main/.github/badges/jacoco.json&style=for-the-badge)
![branches coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator/main/.github/badges/branches.json&style=for-the-badge)
```


### JSON Endpoints from a GitHub Pages Project Site

By using GitHub Pages in combination with the JSON endpoints, we can slightly
simplify the markdown needed to have Shields generate the badges, to the following:

```markdown
![coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/jacoco.json)
![branches coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/branches.json)
```
